### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects.

You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate SSignalKit into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/MtProtoKit/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '7.0'

pod 'MtProtoKit', '~> 0.0.1', :inhibit_warnings => true
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```
